Many other dependencies can be installed via "apt-get" or "yum" if internet access is available.

## Dependencies

When building simulation applications for Windows, please download the pre-packaged mixr-3rdparty binaries zip file that contains compiled versions of all dependency libraries (see above).  For Linux development, depending upon the flavor of your distribution, "apt", "yum" or "dnf" utilities can install many of the required libraries.  As an alternative, please download the 3rdparty source package and use the supplied build script to compile and install most of them.

## Graphics

[freetype](http://freetype.sourceforge.net) : a free, high-quality, and portable font engine.

[FTGL](http://sourceforge.net/projects/ftgl) : a font rendering library for OpenGL.

[freeglut](http://freeglut.sourceforge.net) : an open-source alternative to the OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT) library. GLUT (and hence freeglut) allows the user to create and manage windows containing OpenGL contexts on a wide range of platforms and also read the mouse, keyboard and joystick functions.

## Models

[JSBSim](http://jsbsim.sourceforge.net/) : is an open source flight dynamics model (FDM) that compiles and runs under many operating systems, including Microsoft Windows, Apple Macintosh, Linux, IRIX, Cygwin (Unix on Windows), etc. The FDM is essentially a physics model that defines the movement of an aircraft under the forces and moments applied to it using the various control mechanisms and from the forces of nature.

## Visual Systems

[CIGI](http://cigi.sourceforge.net/) : The Common Image Generator Interface is an open simulation protocol for communication between a host device and an IG. The MIXR platform provides support so that simulation 'host' applications can easily communicate to CIGI interface compatible visual systems.

## Interoperability

[poRTIco project](http://www.porticoproject.org/) : A fully supported, open-source, cross-platform HLA RTI implementation.

## General Networking

[ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org/) : An intelligent message-based transport layer for your distributed applications.
