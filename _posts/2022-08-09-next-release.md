title:  "Working on Next Release"
---
We are diligently working on the next release of MIXR.  Due to current interest, we plan to "wrap up" current work into a release and to eventually "divide" or "partition" MIXR into two packages, 1) the simulation/models/physics of defining and computing entity interactions and 2) the graphical aspects of displaying a virtual world.  The framework has always been organized this way, but explicitly defining these aspects into two clear-cut packages will 1) make it more obvious, and 2) significantly reduce the 3rd party dependencies current provided to compile and run non-graphical examples.  This will also allow the creation of non-graphical container apps to execution simulations, something that is of interest.
