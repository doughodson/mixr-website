title:  "Visual Studio 2015, 2017, 2019, 2022 Compatible ABI"
---
MIXR has been compiled and tested using Visual Studio 2022 Preview 3 (which includes platform toolset v143) - it correctly converts the premake generated files (for 2019) just fine, as well as compiles and links all applications.  This next release includes 64 bit 3rd libraries precompiled using Visual Studio 2019, which means it is compatible with 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2022. Updated 64 bit binaries have been posted.
