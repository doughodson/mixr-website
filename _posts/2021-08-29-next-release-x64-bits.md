title:  "Next Release is 64 Bit Visual Studio Ready"
---
This next release of MIXR is focused not only on general improvements, but direct support for 64-bit Visual Studio compilation.  Supplied pre-compiled 3rd party libraries will be compatible with Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019. Also, almost every single 3rd party dependency library has been updated to the most recent.

MIXR has been used and compiled (for a long time) in 64 bit Linux; this addresses compiling with Visual Studio directly.  Also, the 3rd party source library build script has been significantly improved to compile the absolute latest dependency libraries.
