title:  "Next Release is 64 Bit Visual Studio Ready"
---
This next release of MIXR is focused on improvements and direct support for 64-bit Visual Studio compilation.  Supplied pre-compiled 3rd party libraries will be compatible with Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019.  MIXR has been used and compiled (for a long time) in 64 bit Linux; this next release addresses compiling with Visual Studio.  Also, the build script (used in Linux) has been significantly improved to compile the absolute latest dependency libraries.
