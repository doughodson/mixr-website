title:  "Next Release 64 Bit Visual Studio Ready"
---
This next release of MIXR is focused not only on general improvements, but direct support for 64-bit Visual Studio compilation.  Supplied pre-compiled 3rd party libraries will be compatible with Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019. Also, almost every single 3rd party dependency library has been updated to the most recent.
